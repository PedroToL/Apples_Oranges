Replication Code and Figures for "Apples to Oranges: Imputing Household Income Using Survey Data"

## Abstract 

Accurate and consistent estimation of household income is essential for socioeconomic
research, policy development, and decision-making. However, survey data often lack
complete income information, which challenges the validity and reliability of conclu-
sions drawn from such data. Researchers commonly employ Small Area Estimation
(SAE) techniques to impute household income across surveys. SAE can be categorized
into two main approaches: 1) Model or Regression-based methods and 2) Design-based
methods. In our study, we propose a hybrid approach that combines both methods.
We utilize Machine Learning algorithms for the regression-based component and re-
fine our estimates using empirical survey data containing household income informa-
tion. Specifically, we demonstrate our approach by performing two exercises: imputing
household income from the ENIGH 2016 survey to the ENIGH 2018 survey and vice
versa. Additionally, we apply this imputation technique to the EMOVI 2017 dataset
and estimate inequality of opportunity measures. Our results indicate a promising
improvement compared to the uncorrected imputation.
